# Gathering Requirements - Task Analysis

## Introduction

This task analysis aims to understand how users currently find legal support through existing methods before the development of **JustiLink**. Users often rely on government websites, translation tools, or public forums, but these are not always accessible, user-friendly, or privacy-protected. Understanding these limitations is essential to designing a more effective legal support system.

## Comparison of User Interactions in Task 1

| **Aspect**                    | **Joan(High School Student)**                                                                 | ** Rahim Uddin(Migrant Construction Worker)**                                               | **Emma(Office Worker)**                                                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Motivation/Context**       | Learning rights due to **personal bullying** experience.                                 | Needs to **sign a work contract** with unclear content.                       | Tries to **claim medical benefits** but fears consequences.                |
| **Digital Literacy**         | High – uses browser, search terms, translation, and forums.                              | Moderate – uses translation tools but may not explore alternatives.           | Moderate – searches Google, attempts calling helpline.                     |
| **Language Barrier**         | Faces legal jargon, overcomes it with Google Translate and forums.                       | Major barrier – contract is in English/Malay, translation is poor.            | Struggles with legal terms but can read and understand to a basic extent.  |
| **Support-Seeking Behavior** | Proactively searches for forums, NGOs, alternative sources.                              | May avoid help due to fear, uncertainty, or lack of access.                   | Attempts to seek help (calls helpline), but finds it too complex.          |

### Similarities
All three users shared similar goals in Task 1, as they were trying to understand their rights or obligations related to legal or official matters. They all attempted to obtain information using digital platforms such as web searches, translation tools, or online help services. However, each of them encountered barriers when trying to comprehend the formal or legal content, which often contained complex or unfamiliar language. This difficulty caused confusion, uncertainty, and frustration during their search process. Additionally, all users expressed concerns about their privacy and feared exposure, whether due to embarrassment, potential job risks, or the requirement to enter personal data.

## 📊 HTA Comparison for Task 1 and Discussion
Task 1 involved two personas—Joan, a university student, and Emma, an office worker—who both attempted to access legal information online, specifically regarding bullying laws and employee legal rights. Although both users aimed to understand their legal standing, their HTA steps reveal different user experiences and challenges.

### Differences
Joan began her task by searching for “bullying law in Malaysia” and browsed through various websites (HTA 2.1 → 2.2). She clicked on a relevant article and attempted to read it, but struggled with legal jargon (3.3.2), eventually feeling unsure and overwhelmed (4.2). This reflects her limited familiarity with legal content and her dependence on search results to guide her.

In contrast, Emma used a more technical approach. She connected to public Wi-Fi before searching for legal help as an employee (HTA 1 → 2). Though she successfully accessed a site, she encountered multiple issues—such as pop-ups, unresponsive buttons, and slow loading (3.2 → 3.5)—which disrupted her experience. Despite her better digital literacy, she ultimately exited due to frustration and concern about phone performance (5.1 → 5.2).

### Similarities
Both Joan and Emma experienced difficulties in completing their tasks. Joan was overwhelmed by unreadable legal content, while Emma was frustrated by poor usability and layout. In both cases, the users exited the process without finding a satisfying solution. This highlights a shared pain point: current legal information platforms are not well-optimized for diverse users, whether due to content complexity or interface issues.

### Design Implications
From these HTA comparisons, JustiLink should focus on simplifying legal content and ensuring the platform is user-friendly on all types of devices. For users like Joan, content should be broken into plain language and visually structured. For users like Emma, the system must be optimized for mobile with minimal interruptions and quick loading speeds. These changes can help reduce user drop-offs and improve overall accessibility.

## Comparison of User Interactions in Task 2
| Aspect                              | Joan (High-School Student)                                                                                       | Emma (Office Worker)                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Background and Motivation**        | Motivated by personal safety and justice due to bullying, seeks understanding of her rights, uses digital tools comfortably. | Motivated by financial and job security after a work injury, but fears exposure, job loss, and complex processes.       |
| **Platforms and Paths Taken**        | Joan starts with browser searches, explores NGO sites, checks for live chats, and finally posts on forums like Reddit and Quora. | Emma uses social media platforms, tries posting but hesitates and deletes the post, then gives up.                      |
| **Struggles with Privacy and Emotions** | Joan faces uncertainty and confusion when platforms require personal information but still tries alternative forums. | Emma’s privacy concern is stronger—she worries not only about being identified but also about risking her job. This leads her to stop sooner than Joan. |
| **Emotional Journey and Final Outcome** | Feels hesitant but hopeful, continues searching, leaves with saved links, though her questions are unresolved.         | Feels overwhelmed, frustrated, and discouraged, and completely gives up without obtaining any useful information.        |
| **Who Uses the Shortest Path to Reach a Decision?** | Emma takes the shortest route. She moves from seeking information to deciding not to post and closes her laptop. Her journey ends faster due to greater fear of exposure. | Joan takes a longer, more exploratory path, checking multiple online sources, trying to read content, and even saving links. Despite feeling hesitant, she does not completely abandon the task. |

### Similarities
Both Joan and Emma faced privacy worries when platforms asked for personal details. Neither was able to get clear, trustworthy advice anonymously. They both felt confused, frustrated, and ended their searches without answers.

# 📊 HTA Comparison for Task 2 and Discussion

Task 2 involved two personas: a high school student (Joan) and an office worker (Emma), both trying to seek anonymous legal advice online. Although they shared the same goal, their experiences and decision-making processes differed due to privacy concerns, digital habits, and emotional reactions.

### Differences
oan began her task by searching for legal help about bullying using a browser. According to her HTA, she explored various NGO websites, checked for chat or email options (HTA step 2.1 → 2.3), and later turned to online communities like Reddit or Quora (step 3.1 → 3.3). Although she encountered platforms that required personal information and felt uncertain, she continued exploring different methods. This shows her persistence and willingness to try informal sources even when the official ones were overwhelming.

Emma, on the other hand, chose to start on social media platforms to learn about medical claims (HTA step 1.1 → 2.1). She typed a question asking for help (step 3.1), but after hesitating due to fear of being identified and risking her job, she deleted the post and exited (step 3.3 → 4.1). Her HTA path was shorter, and she disengaged faster compared to Joan, showing that privacy anxiety had a stronger impact on her actions.

### Similarities
Both users struggled with platforms requiring personal information, which made them feel exposed and vulnerable (HTA step 2.3.1 and 3.2). Despite using different platforms, they both failed to find a trusted, truly anonymous legal advice source. Their experiences reflected emotional states like worry, confusion, and frustration, leading both of them to end the task without getting the help they needed. These patterns suggest that current digital tools are not designed well for users seeking anonymous legal guidance.

### Design Implications
The comparison highlights the need for a private and safe legal aid solution. JustiLink should provide anonymous channels like chatbots or masked email systems where users can ask questions without revealing personal details. Additionally, offering step-by-step guidance and reducing barriers (like mandatory sign-ups) will improve the experience, especially for sensitive issues. For users like Emma, clear privacy policies and reassurance about data protection are crucial. For users like Joan, the platform should guide them toward reliable sources without overwhelming legal language. These findings show that anonymity, emotional safety, and simple navigation are key design priorities.

# Comparison of User Interactions in Task 3
 | Aspect                               |  Rahim Uddin(Migrant Construction Worker)                                                    | Emma(Office Worker)                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Background & Motivation**          | Rahim Uddin uses basic phone user limited data to seek legal rights information              | Emma uses budget smartphone user on public Wi-Fi to seek employee legal help                          |
| **Starting Point**                   | Rahim Uddin starts with searching “legal rights” via mobile browser                                      | Emma starts with searching “employee legal help Malaysia” via browser                                        |
| **Interaction & Emotional Response** | Faces slow loading and confusing navigation; quickly frustrated and exits early | Encounters lag, unresponsive buttons, and pop-ups; frustrated but persists before quitting |
| **Main Challenges**                  | Device limitations, low digital literacy, slow site performance                 | Poor UI design, lag, device overheating, and battery drain                                 |

### Similarities
Both the migrant construction worker and the office worker tried to find legal help online by searching on their devices and visiting legal aid websites. Although they used different devices and had different levels of digital skills, they faced similar problems such as slow website loading, difficult navigation, and technical issues. These problems made both users feel frustrated and unhappy, which led them to stop using the websites before finishing their tasks. This shows that no matter what device or background the user has, online legal help platforms need to be easy to use, quick to load, and designed for people with different skills and devices. 

# 📊 HTA Comparison for Task 3 and Discussion

Task 3 involved two personas: the Migrant Construction Worker and the Office Worker, both attempting to find legal help through their mobile devices. Although they shared the same goal, their experiences differed due to factors such as digital literacy, device limitations, and interface usability.
### Differences

The Migrant Construction Worker searched for legal rights using his mobile phone and tried to access a legal aid website. According to his HTA, he navigated the site briefly but gave up after experiencing slow page loading and difficulty scrolling (HTA step 2.2.3 → 3.1). This shows that he may have limited experience with online platforms and quickly disengages when the interface is not responsive.

In contrast, the Office Worker demonstrated more digital confidence. She first connected to public Wi-Fi before searching for employee legal help (HTA step 1 → 2). Although she encountered various interface issues such as pop-up interruptions and unresponsive buttons (step 3.4 → 3.5), she still made several attempts to interact with the content before exiting. This indicates that she was more persistent but still hindered by poor design and usability on her budget smartphone.

### Similarities

Despite their differences, both users encountered challenges that led them to abandon the task. They both faced long loading times (HTA 3.1), cluttered layout (4.1), and frustration with unresponsive website elements. Neither user was able to complete their goal of finding useful legal help, highlighting usability issues that affect users across different backgrounds.

### Design Implications
From these observations, it is clear that JustiLink should prioritize fast loading speeds, responsive design, and user-friendly navigation—especially on low-end devices. For users like the Migrant Construction Worker, the system must be straightforward and lightweight to prevent early drop-off. For more digitally literate users like the Office Worker, the design should still minimize distractions like pop-ups and broken buttons. These insights from HTA analysis help shape a legal aid platform that is inclusive, accessible, and effective for diverse users.


## 📋Design Requirements

The JustiLink system design needs to keep the things users are already familiar with: being able to search for legal information online, through websites, apps, or social media. These platforms help people start learning about their rights and get a sense of what steps they might need to take. But just keeping these isn’t enough. Many users, like Emma, face confusing and complicated systems that leave them feeling overwhelmed.

That’s why we need to introduce new, user-friendly solutions. First, there should be safe, anonymous ways for people to ask questions or seek legal help—whether through a chatbot or a secure hotline—without needing to expose their personal information. The legal information itself needs to be clear, easy to read, and broken down into simple steps, so anyone can understand it. Since many users access these services on their phones, the design has to work well (faster loading, cleaner layouts, and easy-to-use navigation) on all devices, especially on older models with slower internet. Lastly, the system should make it clear how their information is protected and give them choices about what they share, to let people feel safe and in control.
