# Prototyping and Evaluation
## 🤗 Introduction
Our team developed a high-fidelity prototype using Figma to simulate three main tasks aligned with the goals of our project, including allowing users to understand legal information in simple language, allowing users to obtain professional help safely through anonymous chat functions and access legal resources smoothly.

The usability testing took place in several locations. Both User 1 and User 2 completed their sessions in KTDI; while User 3's session took place in L50. The equipment used was laptop and handphone. The prototype was displayed using a laptop, with the front camera continuously recording the user’s facial expressions throughout the test. Meanwhile, the handphone was used to film the session in another angle from a wider angle that included the host in the camera frame. 

To evaluate the usability of our design, three main tasks were tested among three users, each user representing one target group of our project. User 1 representing the first targeted user group - students and youths; User 2 representing the second targeted user group - migrant workers; while User 3 representing the last targeted user group - low income individuals with limited legal knowledge.

Each usability test was conducted by a group member. Michelle Ho Chia Xin was responsible for testing with User 1, Leong Jia Ling handled the session with User 2, and Tay Xin Ying facilitated the test with User 3. This division of tasks helped maintain consistency and focus throughout the evaluation process.

### User Interview Result
**User 1: Teoh Xin Yee**

**Question 1:** What is the thing you like the most about our app?
-	The legal terms translation feature, which transforms complicated legal jargon into simple and understandable language.
-	Particularly beneficial for individuals who are not experts in the legal field, including senior citizens and young people with lower exposure to legal matters.


**Question 2:** Do you find any part of our app problematic?
-	The font used in the legal resources section lacks sufficient contrast with the background, making it difficult to read.
-	The font size is also considered too small, affecting readability.


**Question 3:** What improvements on our app can be done?
-	Increase the font size for better readability.
-	Improve the colour contrast between the font and the background to ensure clear visibility.
-	Avoid using font colours that are similar to the background colour.

**User 2: Evelyn Ang**

**Question 1:** What is the thing you like the most about our app?
-	The "Save for Offline" feature, which allows access to legal resources without the need for an internet connection.


**Question 2:** Do you find any part of our app problematic?
-	In the legal glossary section, users are required to click a small icon on the right side to access definitions.

### Summary of user interviews
The user interviews revealed several positive aspects of the application that were well-received by participants. One of the most appreciated features is the legal terms translation function, which simplifies complex legal language, making the content more accessible to users from all backgrounds, particularly those with limited legal knowledge or lower education levels. Additionally, users found the "Save for Offline" feature extremely useful, as it enables access to legal resources even in the absence of an internet connection. The legal resources section also received positive feedback, with users highlighting the inclusion of illustrations that make the app more visually appealing and engaging. Furthermore, the chatbot feature was praised for its ability to provide quick, customized information, saving users time and effort compared to manual searches. Overall, users found the interface of the application to be user-friendly, especially for newcomers, contributing to a more positive user experience.

Despite the overall positive response, several areas for improvement were identified during the interviews. One of the most frequently mentioned concerns was related to font readability. Users expressed that the font size, particularly in the legal resources section and chatbot section, is too small, and the lack of colour contrast between the font and the background makes the content difficult to read. This poses accessibility issues, especially for older users or those with visual impairments. In the legal glossary section, participants reported frustration with the limited clickable area, as users can only access definitions by clicking a small icon on the right side, rather than the entire section being interactive. Additionally, one participant pointed out that the "Show Both Meaning" checkbox within the glossary settings is redundant, suggesting it be removed for a more streamlined interface. Another concern raised was the small size of buttons in the new chat section and the back button, which can lead to accidental mispresses and hinder smooth navigation.

In conclusion, while the core functionalities and features of the application, such as the legal terms translation, offline access, legal resources, and chatbot, have been well-received, addressing the identified issues related to font readability, button size, and interface navigation will significantly improve the application's usability and enhance the overall user experience.

## 🔍 Findings – prepared by {MICHELLE HO CHIA XIN, LEONG JIA LING, GWEE ZI NI}

| **Problem** | **Solution** | **Remark** |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Small Interactable Area on Glossary Panels** <br>When users 2 tried to click on glossary terms like “Dakwaan Resmi,” only the small arrow icon was clickable, while the rest of the panel was unresponsive. Same issue happened to users 1 and 3 during the usability testing. This caused confusion and reduced usability, as users expected the whole panel to be interactive.| **Expand Clickable Area** <br> Make the entire panel—including the text and background—clickable, not just the arrow icon. This improves usability by aligning with user expectations and making navigation more intuitive. | User 1 – Problem Timestamp: 0:44 <br> [Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pg6tzfiY8EPQygW3sKB87me9MkzhQnD_/view?usp=sharing) <br> <br> User 2 – Problem Timestamp: 0:57 <br> [Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bY0BHQvL7TpqkSsBBskVoBMXLGfwOtjg/view?usp=sharing) <br> <br> User 3 – Problem Timestamp: 0:48 <br> [Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q9zQ8_XLyeEt39kbDR7thntm5kFgYJjg/view?usp=sharing)|
| **Hard-to-Read Text on Suggested Enquiries Panels** <br> The descriptive text under suggested enquiry categories (e.g. “Student & Youth Rights” and “Employment and Labour”) appeared significantly smaller than the button labels. This created a visual imbalance and made the content difficult to read, especially for users on smaller screens. User 3 showed hesitation, indicating that the small font size affected readability and comprehension. | **Increase Font Size** <br>Adjust the font size of the descriptive text to improve readability. Ensure the font size is proportionate to the associated button and follows accessibility guidelines for clarity and contrast. | User 3 – Problem Timestamp: 0:50 <br> [Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N0X6wyz-i5rRpa1KNAXLlD9TVkfRKqkN/view?usp=sharing) |
| **Keyboard Cannot Be Dismissed During Chat Input** <br> After typing in the chat input field, User 3 was unable to close the on-screen keyboard. Tapping outside the input field or on empty screen areas did not dismiss the keyboard. This blocked a significant portion of the screen, including previous messages and interface elements, making it difficult for the user to continue the conversation smoothly. | **Enable Tap-to-Dismiss Function** <br> Allow users to dismiss the keyboard by tapping anywhere outside the input field. This small interaction improvement enhances visibility and ensures a more seamless chat experience, especially on mobile devices. | User 3 – Problem Timestamp: 1:02 <br> [Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N0X6wyz-i5rRpa1KNAXLlD9TVkfRKqkN/view?usp=sharing)|
| **Limited Clickable Area on Chat History Panels** <br> User 3 attempted to tap on a previous chat history panel but found that only a small portion of the panel was responsive. The limited interactive area led to repeated tapping and confusion, as the user expected the full panel—text, background, and borders to be selectable. | **Expand Clickable Area** <br> Ensure the entire chat history panel is clickable, including all visible elements such as background, title, and content preview. This aligns with user expectations and simplifies reaccessing past conversations. |User 3 – Problem Timestamp: 1:34 <br> [Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N0X6wyz-i5rRpa1KNAXLlD9TVkfRKqkN/view?usp=sharing) |
| **Inadequate Tap Target Size for Category Selection** <br> User 3 accidentally tapped the wrong option when trying to select a category under “Know Your Rights.” The interactive tap areas for Students and Youth Protection, Workplace Rights, and Contracts and Wages are too small and too close to each other, making it easy for users to mis-tap, especially on smaller screens. | **Enlarge the Interactive Areas** <br> Increase the size of the clickable zones for each category, making them easier to tap accurately, especially for users with larger fingers or when using smaller devices. | User 3-Problem Timestamp:0:38 <br>[Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NeeY3vJWLTDXHul4CgXmLJfK1ldlLEk-/view?usp=sharing)|
| **Library icon Visibility Issue** <br> User 3 spent some time trying to locate the library icon to view the list of saved information. The icon was not obvious as it was placed at the bottom of the app and used a white color, making it hard to notice. | **Relocate and Highlight the Library Icon for Better Visibility** <br> To improve visibility and accessibility, the library icon should be redesigned with a darker, more contrasting color and repositioned to a more prominent location, such as the top navigation bar. This will help users notice and access the saved content more quickly without confusion. | User 3 Problem Timestamp:2:12 <br> [Watch the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NeeY3vJWLTDXHul4CgXmLJfK1ldlLEk-/view?usp=sharing) |
